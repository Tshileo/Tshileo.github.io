        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey my name is Nathan Tshileo I was born in Zambia but I come from the <abbr title="Democratic Republic of Congo">DRC</abbr>I have two other siblings, an older sister and younger brother. A cool fact about us is that we were all born in different countries, my sister from Congo and my brother from Bostwana. This in now my 4<sup>th</sup> year in Canada. My first winter here will allays be one of the scariest things I've endured. I'm really passionate about sports video games(console and pc) and reading. I don't really not like many things but one thing i'm not a fan of is sushi, whenever I try eating it I just can't swallow for some reason.

            Sports has always been a big factor in my life growing up, I've played various sports like soccer, tennis, swimming and softball etc while growing up. The sport I'm most focused in right now is Basketball. I enjoy gaming on pc with my friends on my free time, I play Smite, Decit, Grand Theft Auto, Overwatch and fortnite the most with my friends. But play games like Nioh, Whitcher 3, Unchrated series and Assassin Creed games, basicly story based games when no ones online. I like reading short stories, japanesse comics and korean webtoons. A quote that lives in my head rent free is <q>No matter how hard or impossible it is, never lose sight of your goal.</q><cite><em>- Monkey D Dragon</em></cite> it's from my favourite anime One Piece
